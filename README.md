# Face_Recognization_Using_Siamese_Network

For One-Shot Learning, this is a simple implementation of Binary Crossentropy Loss. The resized photos were 105*105 pixels in size. The model was trained to decrease the euclidean distance (similarity) between photographs of the same class (in this case, faces of the same person) while simultaneously increasing the euclidean distance between images of different classes.

## Dataset

From Google, 42 photos of three people (14 images each)
were gathered. A pair of similar and non-similar photos is sent
through a convolutional network to determine if they are both of the
same person or not.
